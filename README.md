This repository holds the C and Fortran code for the Gratton, Coles, and Donchin (1983) Eye Movement Correction Proceudure (EMCP).  Please note that some commercial EEG analysis packages that claim to do the Gratton procedure are only doing regression-based eye movement correction. The actual Gratton procedure subtracts the average within independent variable "bins" before computing the regression coefficient.
